# Presentation of the Portfolio

The portfolio is a project that we have in 5ISS at INSA. The goal is to present and analyses different experiences that we had during our curriculum and put them in relation with our professional project. I chose github as the form of the portfolio as it is a tool that is often checked by recruiters and the employees in computer science to evaluate the quantity and quality of someone's work. Considering this, it is form me the most relevant form for my document to be seen by as much person as possible.

# Structure of the Portfolio

At the root of the repository, you can find the [portfolio](./Portfolio_Report.pdf) which is the document listing and analyzing all my experiences of the year.

You can also find in the [Project Report](./Project%20Report/) folder, all the reports of the different classes I attended during the year.

# Special thanks

I would like to use this part to thank all the students of ISS that I had the opportunity to interact with. It was very enriching to exchange an work together and I learnt a lot from our interactions.

I also would like to thank all the teachers of ISS. I could discover a bunch of new fields in which I had no knowledge in like electronics and many others.
